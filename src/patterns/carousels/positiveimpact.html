  <p>
    When we share our stories, listen to others' perspectives, and work together
    toward common goals, we develop empathy, problem-solving skills, and
    confidence. Connection challenges us to see ourselves as part of something
    bigger — reminding us that our actions matter, not just to ourselves, but to
    those around us. By investing in connection—whether through friendships,
    families, or programs like Tiger LINC—we invest in our collective
    resilience. Because the truth is: we heal, grow, and thrive best together.
